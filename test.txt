Connect new output neurons to existing layers

Neurogenesis: For some time keep adding new nodes to process new information
  Possibly if one output is satisfied but the rest aren't (or vice versa) add node connecting unsatisfied values
  Could be done on every layer

Synaptogenesis: When new inputs exceed previous, connect to other active nodes
  Make Graph and connect to active nodes BEFORE this one
  Or just use prior layers

Possibility to drop nodes that consistently output near 0?
  Forget unimportant information
